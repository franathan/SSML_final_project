# SSML_final_project
Final project for Dr. Pyrcz's Subsurface Machine Learning course at the University of Texas at Austin.

# Goal
Create a workflow using Machine learning techniques learned in Dr. Pyrcz's course. This project seeks to predict porosity values from well and seismic data using a Random Forest regressor. For more information about the course check out Dr. Pyrcz's [github](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy).
